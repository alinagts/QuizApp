# QuizApp
This is a Quiz application. It's used to create test for students to examine their knowledge. 
Firstly there is a login form. There are no questions prepared therefore admin have to log in and add some (admin name: John; password: password).

Admin interface allows to add questions, clear the question list and see results of users.

User then can take the test. He or she can take this test again using button "Start again". There is also a timer which shows how much time is left to answer the question (time for each question is 10 seconds).

After students took this test admin can see their scores. Results are sorted, who got the most points is first.
